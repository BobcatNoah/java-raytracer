# java-raytracer
A work in progress java raytracer based off the Ray Tracing in One Weekend guide.
https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

Can be run with
```
javac *.java
java Main > image.ppm
```
Don't expect much just yet. I'm going to implement textures very very soon.

If you're on windows, make sure to run this in CMD, otherwise the ppm file won't be viewable.
